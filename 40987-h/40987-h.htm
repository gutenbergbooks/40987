<h3>
<span>PILGRIMAGES TO THE HOLY LAND.</span>
</h3>

<p>In an article in the <i>Retrospective Review</i> (2nd Series, vol. ii. p.
234.) it is stated that the first book ever printed concerning
Pilgrimages to the Holy Land was the <i>Peregrinatio Bernhardi de
Breydenbach</i>, Mogunti√¶, 1486; and in the Preface to the <i>Pylgrymage of
Sir Richard Guylforde to the Holy Land in 1506</i>, lately published by the
Camden Society, the learned editor remarks that the work of Bernhard de
Breydenbach, <i>Opus transmarin√¶ Peregrinationis ad venerandum et
gloriosum Sepulchrum dominicum in Jherusalem</i> (fol. Mogunt. 1486), is
believed to be the first book of travels that was printed. Having by me
notes of five works printed earlier than that of Breydenbach just
mentioned,&mdash;and all of these, with one exception, being Pilgrimages to
the Holy Land,&mdash;I forward them for publication in "N. &amp; Q.," and
probably some of your correspondents may be able to add to the list.</p>

<p>1. <i>Ludolf von Suchen ("Ludolphus parochialis ecclesi√¶ in Suchen
rector"), De terra sancta et itinere Jhierosolymitano.</i>&mdash;Three undated
editions, but in all probability printed before 1480, are mentioned in
Brunet's <i>Manuel du Libraire</i>. A German translation, entitled, <i>Von dem
gelobten Land vnd Weg gegen Iherusalem</i>, was published at Augsburg in
1477 in 4to. The author travelled about the year 1340. "His journal,"
observes Dr. Robinson (<i>Biblical Researches in Palestine</i>, iii. p. 11.),
"is written with great simplicity, and has something of the marvellous;
but is decidedly the best itinerary of the fourteenth century."</p>

<p>2. <i>Marco Polo</i>, the celebrated Eastern traveller, wrote an account of
his peregrinations in Italian, about the year 1300. A German translation
was printed at Nuremberg as early as 1477, with the following title:
<i>Hie hebt sich an das Puch des edeln Ritters vnd Landtfarers Marcho
Polo; in dem er schreibt die grossen wunderlichen Ding dieser Welt</i>. (In
folio.)</p>

<p>3. <i>Sir John Mandeville.</i> Both French and Italian editions of the
well-known "Marvaylous Travailes" of this worthy knight were printed in
1480. (See Brunet <i>ut supr.</i>)<a id="Page_290"></a> <span class="pagenum">[290]</span></p>

<p>4. <i>Santo Brasca</i>, a gentleman of Milan, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem
in 1480, of which he wrote a journal in Italian, and published it the
following year at Milan. Brunet gives the title as follows: <i>Tutto il
suo Itinerario di giorno in giorno al sanctissima cita di Jerusalem
nell' anno 1480</i>, 4to. This is a very curious and rare book, written in
simple and natural style; and at the end of which are "Instructioni a
ciascuno che desidra fare questo sanctissimo viagio," and two prayers in
verse: "1. Oratione per sancto brascha fatta a piedi nudi in Monte
Calvario a di 29 Julij, 1480: 2. Oratione facta in la vale de Josaphat a
la sepultura de la Vergene Maria."</p>

<p>5. <i>Johann</i> or <i>Hans Tucher</i>, a counsellor (<i>Rathsherr</i>) of Nuremberg,
undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Mount Sinai in the year 1479, in
company with Balthasar, Duke of Mecklenburg, and two of his
fellow-citizens. The title of his itinerary in Brunet is, <i>Wallfart und
Reise in das gelobte Land</i>. Such was its popularity that it passed
through two editions in the same year (1482); the one appearing at
Augsburg, in folio; the other, corrected by the author, at Nuremberg, in
4to. (Vide Will's <i>N√ºrnbergisches Gelehrten-Lexicon</i>.) The work is,
however, very rare. In it full directions are given for the guidance of
all such as might thereafter be disposed to venture forth with scrip and
staff on these pious but somewhat perilous expeditions.</p>

<p>Referring again to Breydenbach, Dr. Kitto (no mean authority) is of
opinion that the account which goes under his name was written by the
Dominican monk Felix Faber, who was Breydenbach's secretary and
companion in the journey. (See Kitto's <i>Physical History of Palestine</i>,
p. 9.)</p>

<h3>
<span>SURNAMES.</span>
</h3>

<p>The subject of surnames has more than once been referred to in the pages
of "N. &amp; Q.," and it may assist those of your readers who have
investigated the question of their origin and use, to offer them the
following examples of peculiar forms of personal designation which occur
in certain of the more ancient public muniments of the city of Norwich.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of Camden, Du Cange, Pegge, Sharon Turner, and other
writers, that the custom of appropriating a permanent appellation to
particular families, became fully established in this country at the
period (sooner or later) of the Norman Conquest. The instances, however,
exhibited below, prove that such custom was not, at any rate,
universally prevalent at that time amongst us. And, indeed, whatever
might have been the case in reference to "the high men of the lond," it
is very certain that surnames, properly so called, were not completely
adopted by the mass of the people until the close of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p>But as the intention of this Note is simply to adduce original examples
of individual designations, without inquiring into the circumstances
attending their acquisition, or pointing to the causes, obvious enough
for the most part, to which their various after-changes and
modifications are to be attributed, the subject calls for no other
general remark, except, perhaps, as to the prefixes "Le"<a id="fixes1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and "De,"
which, it may be noticed in passing, are, though not <i>constantly</i>, as is
commonly asserted, attached to names in records of an older date than
the time of Edward IV., when they began to fall into desuetude.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#fixes1" class="label">[1]</a> This prefix was occasionally in Cheshire, and in the North
with few exceptions, contracted into "A," as Thomas √† Becket, Thomas √†
Dutton, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With these introductory observations are now given, from the source
above indicated,&mdash;</p>

<p>It is also to be noticed that wives, if more than once married, are
frequently described in old documents by the names, distinctly and
united, of their several husbands.</p>

<p>III. Examples of changes in the form of particular designations:</p>

<p>Between 1332 and 1348 the name borne by the famous knight, Sir Rob. de
Salle, commemorated by Froissart, and who was killed by the insurgents
near Norwich in 1381, is severally written, de la Sale, de Salle, de
Aula, de la S'aule, de Halle, Saul, and Halle.</p>

<p>In temps. Ed. II. and III. is the following name thus modified: Fitz
Benedict, Benediscite, Bendiste, Bendish, Bennett.</p>

<p>The twenty-ninth bishop of Norwich (1446-1472) is styled Walter Lyhart,
Le Hert, and Hart.</p>

<p>In 1337 we have "Jas. de Briseworth als. de Bliclingg;" and in 1368,
"Johes. de Welburn (Frat. Thome de Welburn nuper defti), als. de
Cobeslound de Welburne, Taverner."</p>

<p>Then, again, it were easy to produce innumerable examples of
professional and business descriptions, which have originated many
modern surnames, as Joh. le Lytester (Lister, Dyer), Regin, le Paumer
(Palmer), Bateman le Espicer, (Spicer), &amp;c.</p>

<p>But this Note has already somewhat unduly encroached upon your pages;
and it is now brought to a conclusion with the single observation, that
many of the causes of various readings and differences of form in the
same original surname, as well as of a total change from one designation
to another, are now in full force and daily practical operation in many
isolated parts of the country, where, from the predominance of identical
family and baptismal appellations, some method, such as is illustrated
in the foregoing examples, must obviously be adopted, in order to
distinguish one individual from another. In many of the remote valleys,
indeed, of the North of England, a more comprehensive reply might be
given than that which the unsuccessful gaberlunyie woman, mentioned by
Sir W. Scott, received in a certain Scottish dale, when, in the
bitterness of her disappointment, she exclaimed, "Are there no
Christians here?" and was answered, "Christians! nae; we be a' Elliots
and Armstrongs!" So&mdash;but certainly not under like circumstances&mdash;it
might be replied, "We're a' Meccas (Ang. Metcalfes)!"</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Number of Surnames.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Probably some of your numerous correspondents
could give me some idea as to the number of surnames there are in this
country used by British subjects. We have no good work on surnames, as
those of Lower and others do not go sufficiently into the subject to
satisfy the curiosity of those who wish to know the origin and date of
the names in use among us. A work of some study and research, giving all
the names in use at present in the country, and showing when they were
first adopted or brought into the country, with the changes that have
been made in them, would be very interesting, and as worthy, if not more
so, than many that are brought before the public.</p>

<p class="right">    J. H.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I would suggest that the names should be classed in the different
periods of history, beginning with the Britons.</p>




<h3>
<span>LICENSE TO MAKE MALT IN 1596.</span>
</h3>

<p>Among the old family deeds relating to the manor of Wishanger, I find
the following curious and interesting document. It affords evidence that
in 1596 there was a dearth of corn which was general through the
kingdom; that barley was then much used for bread; that there was a
custom, either general, or occasioned by the scarcity, that the poor
should be served in open market, at an accustomed hour; that one of the
means relied upon to supply food to the people was to restrain the
making of malt; and, therefore, that malt liquor must have been very
generally consumed by our forefathers at that time.</p>

<p>The writing is in perfect preservation, and the ink jet black.</p>

<p>I give it in the original orthography, according to the literature of
those easy times when every man spelled that that was right in his own
eyes and the world was little troubled with dictionaries or critics.</p>

<h3>
<span>WHERE LOLLARD WAS BURIED, AND WHAT BECAME OF HIS BONES.</span>
</h3>

<p>In referring to the passage of Heda's history relating to
bishop-boiling, the following curious fact caught my eye. Speaking of
the same bishop, Florentius de Wevelichoven, he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Fecit et exhumari ossa cujusdam h√¶retici Matth√¶i Lollaert atque
   ante atrium Pontificale comburi, cineresque in fossas urbis
   dispergi."&mdash;<i>Hist. Episcopor. Ultraject.</i> p. 259.</p>

<p>Now though the Christian name, <i>Matth√¶us</i>, of this Lollaert does not
agree with that usually assigned to Lollard, viz., <i>Walter</i>; nor yet
this assertion that his bones were dug up, and burned at Utrecht, with
the current story that Lollard was buried alive at Cologne; yet it is
evident from the note upon this passage on p. 263., that Heda is
speaking of the founder of the sect of the Lollards. In this note he
refers to Prateolus and Walsingham, to which I turned in order to
ascertain where he got his information; but, alas, in vain! They only
give a very meagre account of the origin of the Lollards. Heda must
therefore have had some independent source from which he wrote, as he
could hardly have invented the story. The form of name, <i>Lollaert</i>,
would make it more than probable that Lollard was a Dutchman, which
agrees very well with the account that he preached in Germany.</p>

<p>How much is it to be wished that some member of the many learned Dutch
Antiquarian Societies now in existence, would endeavour <i>at last</i> to
clear up the history of Lollard by reference to the records of the city
of Utrecht, if they are still in being, and extend so far back as the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Florentius became Bishop of Utrecht in 1379, and died 1394.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Churching of Women.</i></span>
</h4>
<p>
&mdash;In Herefordshire it is considered <i>contra bonos
mores</i> for the husband to appear in church on the day of his wife's
churching, or, at all events, in the same pew with her. An antiquary of
that county considers this a relic of Roman paganism, connected with the
worship of Bona Dea. Query, is this so elsewhere?</p>

following particulars respecting the apple-tree superstitions, as they
prevail in this county; and it is as <i>well to preserve</i> the
<i>recollection</i> of them, for I suspect they are wearing away. In this
neighbourhood (Chailey) the custom of wassailing the orchards still
remains. It is called apple-howling. A troop of boys visit the different
orchards, and encircling the apple-trees they repeat the following
words:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Stand fast root, bear well top,</p>
      <p>Pray the God send us a good howling crop.</p>
   <p>   Every twig, apples big,</p>
      <p>Every bough, apples enow.</p>
      <p>Hats full, caps full,</p>
     <p> Full quarters, sacks full."</p>

</div>


<p>They then shout in chorus, one of the boys accompanying them on the
cow's horn; during this ceremony they rap the trees with their sticks.
This custom is alluded to in Herrick's <i>Hesperides</i>, p. 311.</p>


   <div class="poem">

<p>&mdash;"The schoolmaster with his primer in his hand," to quote
Lord Brougham, is unquestionably abroad, and dispelling, with surprising
rapidity, the prejudices of the people; in some cases, perhaps, to make
way for prejudices yet stronger and more tenacious than those they
displace. You are doing good service by collecting and recording some of
those that are fast disappearing. In this neighbourhood I know ladies
who consider it "lucky" to find <i>old iron</i>; a horse shoe or a rusty nail
is carefully conveyed home and hoarded up. It is also considered lucky
if you see the <i>head</i> of the first lamb in spring; to present his <i>tail</i>
is the certain harbinger of misfortune. It is also said that if you have
money in your pocket the first time you hear the cuckoo, you will never
be without all the year. The magpie is a well-known bird of omen. The
following lines were familiar when I was a boy:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "One for sorrow, two for mirth,</p>
    <p>  Three for a wedding, four for death;</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Lambs.</i></span>

year. If their heads are towards them it is lucky; if their tails, great
misfortunes will ensue.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Key Experiments</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 152.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Perhaps J. P. Jun. may not be
aware that an experiment somewhat similar to these is practised in the
Isle of Man. The operator holds a thread between the finger and thumb,
with a shilling fixed horizontally to it, gradually drops the shilling
into a glass, and after it has once become stationary, the shilling
begins to oscillate, and, as the superstition goes, invariably strikes
the hour of the day against the glass. I have frequently practised it,
and consider the motive power to be the pulse, which is completely under
the operator's control. This performance has been known in the Isle of
Man certainly more than a century, and bears a resemblance to the
experiments of Mayo and Reichenbach with the Od Force, or the vagaries
of the Magnetoscope.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your correspondents can instance cases and tricks of
this kind of much earlier date.</p>

<span>"<i>Black Book of Scone.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The <i>Black Book of Scone</i>, containing the
history of Scotland from Fergus I., was in Sir Robert Spottiswood's
library, and was given by Lewis Cant (a Covenanting minister) to
Major-General Lambert, and by Lambert to Col. Fairfax; which book
Charles I. had ransomed from Rome by a considerable sum of money: and it
is certain Archbishop Spottiswood had it and the <i>Black Book of
Paisley</i>, signed by three abbots, when he compiled his <i>History</i>, which,
with the famous <i>Red Book of Pluscardine</i>, Buchanan says he had, and
frequently cites.&mdash;Sir George Mackenzie's <i>Defence of the Antiquity of
the Royal Line of Scotland</i>; and also <i>Lives of Scotch Writers</i>.</p>

<p>The fate of the <i>Black Book of Scone</i> may be a clue to the inquirer
after the <i>Black Book of Paisley</i>. It is not now in the library at
Spottiswood; and most of Sir Robert Spottiswood's property was pillaged
and ransacked during his imprisonment.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cracked Glass.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Some years ago, being a schoolboy at the time, I spent
my Christmas holidays at my grandfather's house in Somersetshire. The
members of the family were assembled for evening prayer, when suddenly
music, resembling that of an √Üolian harp, was heard, produced apparently
by some person upon the lawn immediately beneath the window. As soon as
the prayers were concluded I opened the hall door, and was greatly
surprised to find the musician had departed. On returning to the
drawing-room I was informed that the moment I had left the room the
music ceased. Believing that some village friend had come to serenade
us, we drew our chairs round the fire in expectation of his return. A
few minutes only elapsed when the music was again distinctly heard. A
second visit was made to the hall door, but with no better success. It
was then resolved to open the shutters, which was no sooner done than
the mystery was clearly explained. During the day a pane of glass had
been cracked, and the music was produced by the two pieces of glass
vibrating against each other. We found, from repeated experiments, that
it required the atmosphere of the room to be at rather a high
temperature to produce the effect, for the moment the door, or one of
the other windows, was opened, the vibration ceased. I have only to add
that the music was very pleasing to the ear, and consisted of rapid
cadences. I have often mentioned the circumstance, but I never found any
one who had met with a similar <i>musical fracture</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>LEGAL WORTHIES, QUERIES RESPECTING.</span>
</h3>


<p>I shall be much obliged for any information or hints as to the following
Queries:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Is there any list extant of the Prothonotaries of the Supreme Courts
of Judicature from the time of Edward III. downwards, or any source from
which their names could be obtained? Was John Hayward a prothonotary of
one of the courts in Edward III.'s time, or during the reign immediately
following? or can any information be furnished about a lawyer of that
name about that time?</p>

<p>2. Is anything known of a place called "Schypmen Hall" existing in
London or elsewhere in the time of Edward IV.?</p>

<p>3. When did "Mr. Goldsborough, one of the Prothonotaries of the Common
Banke," flourish?</p>

<p>4. Is anything known of Traherne, said to have<a id="Page_295"></a> <span class="pagenum">[295]</span> been reader at
Lincoln's Inn temp. Hen. VIII., whose <i>Reading on Forest Laws</i> is much

<h3>
<span>TOWN HALLS.</span>
</h3>


<p>I have to thank two of your correspondents for their Notes in answer to
my Query respecting medi√¶val towns built on a regular plan in England.
They have reminded me of Hull and Wokingham, with both which places I
was previously acquainted; neither of them is by any means of the same
regular and perfect plan as the English towns in France, but they
approximate to it in some degree; and I am not the less obliged for
being reminded of them. My success in this instance encourages me to
trouble you with another Query. Can any of your correspondents furnish
me with information respecting any medi√¶val town halls remaining in
England? I am acquainted with several, but believe there are many more
than is commonly supposed. Some of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
are mentioned in Mr. Turner's work on <i>Domestic Architecture</i>, as the
County Hall at Oakham; the Guildhall at Lincoln; the King's Hall at
Winchester. In addition to these, the Guildhall at Exeter is partly of
the thirteenth century, and partly of the fifteenth. The old Town Hall
at Colchester of the twelfth has, I believe, been destroyed within these
few years. The Town Hall at Winchelsea is of the time of Edward I.,
though mutilated. The Town Hall at Aldborough is of the fifteenth
century, or earlier. The hall of St. Mary's Guild at Coventry is a
well-known and beautiful example. The Town Hall of Weobly in
Herefordshire is, if I remember rightly, an early example of timber
work. These are a few instances which occur to my memory. I have no
doubt there are many others; and, as the subject is one of considerable
interest, perhaps you will not object to assist me in collecting
information upon it. You will observe that I include under the general
name of Town Halls all public halls, whether called by that name or by
any other. I am aware that they do not all belong to the same class,
strictly speaking; but I should be glad to know of other examples of any
of them.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Chasseurs Britanniques.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;This regiment is noticed under the head of
"Foreign Corps on English half-pay," in the <i>Army List</i> for 1850-1, pp.
494. 530. Can any of your readers favour me with some particulars
regarding it, and when and where it was raised, &amp;c.?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Knights Templars and Freemasons.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me
what connexion has ever existed between the Knights Templars and the
Freemasons, as there is a degree in Freemasonry called the Knight
Templar's degree? It is supposed that the persecuted Templars betook
themselves to the Freemasons' lodges, and secured their protection. The
two orders became closely connected, the succession of Grand Masters
kept up, and the ritual of the Templars preserved. There is a French
order of Knights Templars, which claims direct succession from Jacques
de Molay, the last Grand Master of the original order; but the
Freemasons say that this is a spurious body, and that the only
legitimate claimants to representation of this once powerful order are
the Freemasons.</p>

<p>I shall be glad if any of your readers can give such information as may
aid my inquiries into this subject; or if they can furnish me with the
titles of such works as are most likely to aid my researches. My object
is to trace the history of the order of Knights Templars subsequent to
the persecution and death of Jacques de Molay, and to ascertain the
correctness of the statements of those who profess to be the proper
representatives of the order.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>St. Christopher.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." supply any
information which will assist my researches into the real meaning of the
representations of St. Christopher, which are so frequently found on the
north walls of churches? I have read Mr. Duke's essay on the subject in
the <i>Prolusiones Historic√¶</i>, but do not quite agree in his view of the
meaning which these singular paintings were intended to convey. Why
should this saint, of whom so little is correctly known and of whom
Alban Butler gives a very scanty account, occupy such a very important
position in the iconography of the medi√¶val church, and which it appears
has not been maintained by the Roman Catholics of the present day? I am
quite aware of the doggrel lines occasionally found underneath these
representations, ascribing extraordinary powers of cure to the picture
when looked upon by the faithful; but I cannot think that this reason
alone would have led to the adoption of this extraordinary
representation in almost all our parish churches. Are there any known
representations of St. Christopher in painted glass; if so, where?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Arnold Bilson's Wife.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me who was "the
daughter of the house of Bavaria" married to <i>Arnold Bilson</i>,
great-grandfather of Thomas Bilson, Bishop of Winchester (who died
1616); and under what circumstances the marriage took place?<a id="Page_296"></a> <span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>It seems there was some romance in the case, as, according to memorandum
(<i>Lib. Coll. Arm.</i>, c. 19. p. 48., and <i>Harl. MS.</i> 1101. p. 29. [1582]),
the arms granted by the duke to his son-in-law were&mdash;"azure, per pole, a
rose and thistle, pper;" crest, "a horn, or." This union of what I
apprehend to be the royal and plebeian flowers, would seem to indicate
that the husband was merely a "roturier;" and, indeed, the "horn" itself
may point to his occupation, as it is the simple hunting instrument of
the time.</p>

Both command most extensive views; and, on the table-rock of each, I
noticed circular basins, with channels by which superfluous fluid may be
carried off. Tradition says, that in remote ages they were used as
druidical altars; and, that in later days, after the introduction of
Christianity<a id="Page_297"></a> <span class="pagenum">[297]</span> into England, mass was occasionally celebrated upon
them. In some of the local guide-books they are called <i>Almias</i> Cliff.

<p>&mdash;Having sometimes occasion to

<h3>
<span>ORIGINAL LETTER OF GENERAL JAMES WOLFE.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 34. 136. 185.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I beg to renew my acknowledgments to the various gentlemen who have
afforded additional information respecting this brave man. So little has
been recorded of his personal history, that every item which can be
gleaned is valuable. It is certainly strange that no proper memoir of
one so distinguished in arms as Wolfe has yet been written. His career,
though short, was brilliant and embraces a period of time, as well as
events, which would render a sketch of his life, by a competent writer,
singularly interesting. Materials do not seem wanting; the detached
pieces of information, and references to sources where more may be
obtained, which have already appeared in "N. &amp; Q." since I ventured to
start the subject in October last, indicate, that with a little industry
and research in proper quarters, Wolfe's history can yet be written to
advantage. England's young hero has, in this respect, been too much
neglected. Surely this national reproach will not be allowed to
continue.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for January last, there is a very
interesting letter from Wolfe to a young officer on the subject of
military studies, supplied from the rich MS. stores of Mr. Robert Cole.
I am enabled to contribute the fragment of another letter from Wolfe,
also to a very young officer, pointing out how he ought to conduct
himself on entering the army. This fragment was discovered within these
few weeks, in the same old<a id="Page_299"></a> <span class="pagenum">[299]</span> military chest where the twelve
letters in my possession were found, to which I formerly alluded. This
fragment, though neither dated, signed, nor addressed, is in Wolfe's
handwriting beyond all doubt. I have compared it with his other letters,
and not only do I find the resemblance perfect, but the paper on which
the fragment is written is identically the same with several of these
letters, the water-mark being the very appropriate one for a soldier,
"pro <i>patria</i>." This newly discovered portion of Wolfe's letter is
written closely on two pages of a sheet of post paper; and from
circumstances I am inclined to think the date must have been in the end
of 1757, when he was at Blackheath, soon after his return from the
descent on Rochefort, in which he held a command. I am unable, however,
to point out the name of the young officer for whose advantage the
fragmentary epistle was written; but he was evidently one in whose
welfare Wolfe took much interest, and intimate in Wolfe's family. The
introductory words, "<i>Dear Huty</i>," seem to be an affectionate
abbreviation of the young gentleman's surname; but how the fragment came
amongst the papers of Wolfe's other friend, Lieut.-Col. Rickson, to whom
the whole of the twelve letters in my possession are addressed, I cannot
at present say. Here is an exact copy, viz.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "Dear Huty,</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "By a Letter from my Mother I find you are now an officer in Lord
   Chs. Hay's Regiment, which I heartily give you Joy of, and as I
   sincerely wish you success in Life, you will give me Leave to
   give you a few Hints which may be of use to you in it. The Field
   you are going into is quite new to you, but may be trod very
   safely, and soon made known to you, if you only get into it by
   the proper Entrance. I make no doubt but you have entirely laid
   aside the Boy and all Boyish amusements, and have considered
   yourself as a young man going into a manly profession, where you
   must be answerable for your own conduct. Your character in life
   must be that of a Soldier, and a Gentleman: the first is to be
   acquired by application and attendance on your duty; the second,
   by adhering most strictly to the Dictates of Honour, and the
   Rules of Good Breeding. To be more particular in each of these
   points; when you join your Regiment, if there are any Officer's
   Guard mounted, be sure constantly to attend the Parade, observe
   carefully the manner of the officers taking their Posts, the
   exercise of their Espontoon, &amp;c.; when the Guard is marched off
   from the Parade, attend it to the Place of Relief, and observe
   the manner and form of Relieving, and when you return to your
   chamber (which should be as soon as you cou'd, lest what you saw
   slip out of your Memory), consult Bland's Military Discipline on
   that Head; this will be the readiest method of learning this part
   of your Duty, which is what you will be the soonest call'd on to
   perform.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "When off Duty get a Serg<span class="topnum">t</span> or a Corporal, whom the Adjutant will
   recommend to you, to teach you the Exercise of the Firelock,
   which I beg of you to make yourself as much master of as if you
   were a simple soldier; the exact and nice knowledge of this will
   readily bring you to understand all other parts of your Duty,
   make you a proper judge of the performance of the Men, and
   qualify you for the post of an Adjutant, and in time many other
   employments of Credit. When you are posted to your Company, take
   care that the Sergeants or Corporals constantly bring you the
   orders; treat those officers with kindness, but keep them at a
   Distance, so will you be beloved and respected by them; read your
   orders with attention, and if anything in particular concerns
   yourself, put it down in your Memorandum Book, which I wou'd have
   you constantly in your Pocket ready for any Remarks; be sure to
   attend constantly morning and evening the Roll Calling of the
   Company, watch carefully the Absentees, and enquire into reasons
   for their being so, and particularly be watchfull they do not
   endeavour to impose on you sham Excuses, which they are apt to do
   with young officers, but will be deterr'd from it by a proper
   severity in detecting them;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here, unfortunately, the remainder of the sheet has been torn off, and
the continuation of the excellent precepts it no doubt contained, is
irretrievably lost. Enough has luckily been preserved to show what an
admirably disciplined soldier mind Wolfe possessed, taken in conjunction
with the outline of military reading, pointed out in the letter
contributed by Mr. Cole, already alluded to, and written with the same
kindly object (the instruction of youthful officers), probably only a
few months prior to the date of the mutilated one.</p>

<p>As it may be thought desirable to say something more than I have done,
regarding the packet of Wolfe's letters in my custody, I beg to state
that the officer to whom they are all addressed, was William Rickson, a
native of Pembroke. He was eight years older than Wolfe. They appear to
have served together in Flanders. Both were at the battle of Dettigen,
and their names appear in the list of promotions consequent on that
victory. Rickson and young Wolfe were also in the same regiment,
commanded by Wolfe's father, in Flanders. I think it was then known as
"Onslows." Both father and son appear to have felt a strong attachment
to Rickson: this appears from the letters. On the part of James Wolfe in
particular, this attachment was of the most ardent description. In one
letter, dated Banff (Scotland), 9th June, 1751, he thus writes to
Rickson:<a id="Page_300"></a> <span class="pagenum">[300]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot"> "I believe that no man can have a sincerer regard for you than
   myself, nor can any man wish to serve and assist you with more
   ardour;" and "Attachments between men of certain characters do
   generally arise from something alike in their natures, and should
   never fall from a certain degree of firmness, that makes them the
   same all the world over, and incapable of any diminution. I have
   (as you justly acknowledge) a perseverance in friendship, that
   time, nor distance, nor circumstance, can defeat,&mdash;nay, even
   neglect can hardly conquer it; and you are just as warm and as
   near me in North America as you would be upon the spot."</p>

<p>Rickson survived Wolfe eleven years, and I possess the key of the tomb
in which his remains repose in Restalrig churchyard, near Edinburgh. A
fine miniature of him in his antique regimentals also exists; and it is
interesting to contemplate the lineaments of a countenance so familiar
to Wolfe, and of a man to whom the latter seems to have communicated his
inmost thoughts. There are passages in the letters indicative of this to
a degree, that I felt bound in honour not to disclose. Rickson died a
lieutenant-colonel in 1770. His antique military chest remained in
possession of relatives in Scotland almost forgotten, till about three
years ago curiosity prompted the examination of a mass of old papers,
covered with dust, lying at the bottom of it. A number of curious
documents have thus been brought to light, including a file of letters
to Rickson from the Duke of Queensbury (under whose auspices he
constructed the military roads in Gallowayshire) and other distinguished
personages of the last century, but best of all twelve invaluable
letters from the lamented Wolfe, tied up by themselves, probably by
Rickson, as memorials of his bosom friend who fell in the arms of
victory. It was, as already said, among these old papers that the
fragment of the letter above quoted was also found lately, on a more
careful inspection of the antique chest in which they lay. I was so much
struck with the noble sentiments expressed by Wolfe in the letters, that
I ventured to write a short sketch of him from very imperfect materials,
which appeared, along with the letters themselves, <i>ad longam</i>, in
Tait's <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> for December, 1849. Had I been aware of some
of the facts which have since been contributed to the "N. &amp; Q.," I would
have modified certain passages in the narrative. All I aimed at,
however, was merely to elucidate the letters which accident placed in my
custody. But I now earnestly invite some competent writer to rescue
Wolfe's history from the undeserved neglect and obscurity in which it is
at present shrouded. I shall cheerfully allow any such party access to
the whole letters, under proper guards for their safety, and my address
has been left with the Editor accordingly.</p>

<h3>
<span>EARL OF CHEPSTOW.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 126. 204. 261.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The seeming difficulty regarded in these communications arises from
Hooker's unauthorised translation of "Comes Strigulensis" into "Earl of
Chepsto<i>ne</i>," and in a phrase of ancient parlance appearing a Title of
Dignity. The error does not exist in the original work, as Giraldus
wrote "Dermutius Morchardi filius, Lagenensium Princeps, <i>Ricardo Comiti
Strigulensi, Gilleberti Comitis filio</i>, S."&mdash;Camden's <i>Anglica</i>, &amp;c., p.
767.</p>

<p>The town, called in later times <i>Chepstow</i> by the English, and sometimes
<i>Cas Gwent</i>, or <i>Castell Gwent</i>, by the Welsh, is clearly <i>Strigul</i> (as
shown in Lhwyd's <i>Commentariolum</i>, p. 102. edit. 1731, and
<i>Arch√¶ologia</i>, vol. xxix. p. 31.); but these names are not precisely
equivalent. In early documents the Town, Vill, or Burgh is thus
variously named, and the style of the present Court Baron is, "the
Honour of Chepstow, <i>alias</i> Striguil;" but in old charters and
chronicles the Lordship Marcher, the castle, and the honorary
description of its lords, are usually designated by the word "Strigul"
(variously written) only; and of this "Hooker <i>alias</i> Vowell" was
perhaps ignorant. Giraldus himself is correct, as shown above.</p>

<p>As to the style of "Earl of Strigul," Dugdale admits the use of it by
Richard Fitz-Gilbert, who occurs as "Comes Strigulensis" above, and as
"Ricardus Comes de Striguil Dermuciigener," in Ralph de Diceto (p.
590.). His descendant Gilbert Marescall is also termed "Counte de
Strogoile" in the petition of Margaret, daughter of Thomas de
Brotherton, at the coronation of Richard II. (Vincent's <i>Corrections</i>,
p. 345.) There is a stronger instance in Selden's <i>Titles of Honour</i> (p.
617. edit. 1631), correctly cited from Hoveden, and mentioning the fact
of William Marshall and Geoffrey Fitz-Peter being severally girded
"<i>gladio Comitatus de Striguil</i> et gladio Comitatus de Essex," at the
coronation of King John, with remarks on their previous rank as earls,
their administration of earldoms, but their non-investiture, and their
sitting at the royal table in consequence of this investiture.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is laid down in the third <i>Report on the Dignity of a
Peer</i>, p. 146., that such expressions are to be considered vague. It
refers, for instance, any description of Roger de Montegomeri, as Earl
of Arundel (if such exists), to <i>residence</i>; adding, "that is, he was an
earl, and from his <i>residence</i> was denominated Earl of Arundel, <i>as the
Earls of Pembroke were denominated Earls of Strigul</i>, a castle which
appears to have been built by William Fitz-Osborn, Earl of Hereford, and
which had <i>no connexion</i> with the county of Pembroke."</p>

<p>As to the immediate parentage of Earl Richard Fitz-Gilbert, proof will
be readily found in the<a id="Page_301"></a> <span class="pagenum">[301]</span> Foundation Charters of St. Neot's Priory
and Tintern Abbey, in Gorham's <i>St. Neot's</i>, p. cv.; <i>Monasticon</i>, vol.

<h3>
<span>DEATHS FROM FASTING.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 247.)
</span>
</h3>


<p>In the parish church of Tenby there is an emaciated figure, lightly
wrapped in a winding-sheet, which is supposed to represent Tully, Bishop
of St. David's, of whose death a tradition, similar to that related by
B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>, is current. I should mention that there is also in the same
church another monument of a bishop (as is shown by the still
distinguishable mitre and crozier), which is also stated to be his. I
have been informed that where a monument was surmounted by a
representation of an emaciated corpse (emblematic of the poverty of
spirit in which the original was supposed to live and die), it was usual
to erect a second effigy, representing the departed as he actually
appeared to his fellow men. This last sentence I must however put in the
form of a Query, in the hope that some of your correspondents may answer
it with special reference to the supposed tomb, or tombs, of Bishop
Tully?</p>

  <p class="right">   S<span class="smcap lowercase">ELEUCUS</span>.</p>


<p>There are two monuments of the description respecting which
 B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>
desires information in the county of Devon. One against the south wall
of the chancel of Feniton Church, is an elegant altar tomb ornamented
with quatrefoils, on which lies the effigy in a shroud, tied at the head
and feet. This may be assigned to the thirteenth century, but nothing
appears to indicate whether it is the monument of a priest or of one of
the Malherbe family, who were the lords of the soil. The other similar
monument is in the north aisle of the choir of Exeter Cathedral, and is
of later date. The skeleton figure lies on a slab in a recess under an
obtuse arch, all highly decorated with tracery, panels, and foliage.
This is said to be to the memory of Canon Parkhouse, buried in 1540. See
<i>Gough. Sepulch. Mon.</i> Introd. p. 111.; and Britton's <i>Exeter
Cathedral</i>, p. 139., and plate xxii.</p>

  <p class="right">    J. D. S.</p>


<p>In the north aisle of Exeter Cathedral there is an instance similar to
that mentioned by your correspondent, B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>, of a monument with the
figure of a human skeleton lying at full length on a winding sheet. The
following inscription is over the arch:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p> "Ista figura docet: nos omnes premeditari </p>
<p> Qualiter ipsa nocet:    mors quando venit dominari."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Tradition ascribes it to Bishop Lacy's tomb, and the vergers even at the
present day inform visitors that it was erected to commemorate his
attempt to fast during Lent. It is an exquisite piece of work. An
engraving of it may be found in Britton's <i>Exeter Cathedral</i>. I have
heard that there is a similar monument in Salisbury Cathedral, and it
appears probable, from there being more than one, that it was a
favourite device to represent the instability of human grandeur.</p>

  <p class="right">   E<span class="smcap lowercase">XONIENSIS</span>.</p>


<p>There is a tradition similar to that related by B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>, and alike
unfounded, concerning Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, who is buried on the
north side of the choir of Lincoln cathedral in a chapel of his own
foundation. On the floor is an image of a decayed skeleton-like body; on
the tomb above, his effigy arrayed in his episcopal robes.</p>

  <p class="right">    K. P. D. E.</p>


<p>I would remind your correspondent B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span> of the splendid monument in
Winchester cathedral, beneath which are deposited the remains of Richard
Fox, Bishop of Winchester, and founder of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, who died here on the 14th of September, 1528. In an oblong
niche, under the third arch, lies the figure of Bishop Fox, represented
as an emaciated corpse in a winding-sheet, with his feet resting on a
skull. It is a tradition of the vergers that he died whilst endeavouring
to imitate the example of Our Lord by a fast of forty days.</p>

<p>The figure of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, is also
represented, like that of Fox, as a skeleton; and the same tale of a
forty days' fast traditionally delivered by the same authorities.</p>

<h3>
<span>BURNING FERN BRINGS RAIN.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 242.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Your correspondent <span title="[Greek: m]">&#956;</span> asks whether any traces of such a popular
belief exist at present.</p>

<p>In the Highlands of Scotland, where at this season the heather is burned
by the shepherds, the belief is general among the people; I may add that
it is a belief founded on observation. In Australia a hot wind blowing
from the north caused (in part at least) by bush fires in the interior,
is invariably succeeded by rain from the opposite part.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult, perhaps, to assign a satisfactory reason for
a meteorological fact, which by a misnomer is dubbed "Folk Lore."</p>

     <p class="right">   W. C.</p>


<p>It is believed in the neighbourhood of Melrose that burning the heather
brings rain.</p>

<p>It must be remarked that Tweeddale runs mainly west and east; that the
heather-covered hills are all to the <i>west</i> of this place. West wind
brings rain.</p>

  <p class="right">   &#8224;</p>


<p>In the north of England, and in Scotland, and probably in all moorland
districts of the country, it is the practice of shepherds in spring,
when the<a id="Page_302"></a> <span class="pagenum">[302]</span> heather is dry enough, to set fire to it and burn large
tracts of it, in order to get rid of the old woody plants. The young
heather which springs up from the roots produces much better and more
palatable food for the sheep. In this process, which takes place at the
same time in a whole district (viz. when there has been no rain for some
time), the whole air becomes loaded with smoke, and a very misty state
of the atmosphere is produced. It is the general belief throughout the
south of Scotland and in the Cheviot range, that this burning "doth draw
downe rain."</p>

<p>Luckily this season, though there has been much moor burning, the
general expectation has been agreeably disappointed, and the weather has

<h3>
<span>THE FISH CALLED "VENDACE."<br />
(Vol. iii., p. 301.)</span>
</h3>


<p>A short time since, an eminent naturalist directed my attention to
Yarrell's <i>History of British Fishes</i> (2 vols. 8vo. 1836, and
<i>Supplement</i>, 1839), with reference to this curious fish.</p>

<p>Mr. Yarrell does not attempt to identify the vendace with any foreign
species, nor to answer the question, who introduced them in Lochmaben?
However, his account of the other species of the genus <i>Coregonus</i> in
Great Britain is well worth giving.</p>

<p>The species of the genus <i>Coregonus</i> are numerous in Europe, and several
of them are so similar to each other that they are often confounded.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Some writers have even considered the Vendisse of Lochmaben as
   the same with the <i>Powan</i> of [Loch Lomond] Perthshire, the
   <i>Schelly</i> of Cumberland, the <i>Gwyniad</i> of Wales, and the <i>Pollan</i>
   of Ireland. This is not the case, for the Pollan of Ireland is
   distinct from the two species of <i>Coregonus</i> found in Great
   Britain."</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "The <i>Gwyniad</i> is very numerous in Ulswater and other large lakes
   of Cumberland, where on account of its large scales it is called
   the <i>Schelly</i>. The fish is not unlike a herring in appearance;
   the Welsh term <i>Gwyniad</i> has reference to their silvery white
   colour."</p>

<p>Izaak Walton notices it at the end of chap. xiii.:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Nor would I have you ignorant of a rare fish called a
   <i>Guiniad</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <i>Pollan</i> is principally found in Loch Neagh, also in Loch Derg and
Loch Erne. Mr. Thompson, of Belfast, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The habits of this fish do not, with the exception of having
   been in some instances taken with the artificial fly, differ in
   any marked respect from those of the Vendace of Scotland, or the
   Gwyniad of Wales, and are in accordance with such species of
   Continental Europe as are confined to inland waters, and of whose
   history we have been so fully informed by Bloch."</p>

<p>In 1835, Mr. Thompson published some observations on this species. The
earliest notice of it that he has seen, occurs, he says, in Harris's
<i>History of County Down</i>, 1744.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The Vendace or Vendis (<i>Coregonus Willughbii</i>); Vendace,
   <i>Jardine</i>; Vangis and Juvangis, Penn, <i>Brit. Zool.</i>, vol. iii. p.
   420.; Vendace, Knox, <i>Trans. R.S.E.</i>, vol. xii. p. 503.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "But little is known of this delicate fish," says Mr. Yarrell,
   "beyond what has been published by Sir William Jardine, Bart., in
   the 3rd volume of the <i>Edinb. Journal of Nat. and Geog. Science</i>,
   and by Dr. Knox. The Vendace is only known in the lochs in the
   neighbourhood of Lochmaben, in Dumfriesshire. Sir W. Jardine
   says, 'The story that it was introduced into these lochs by the
   unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, is mentioned by Pennant in his
   description of the Gwyniad, (and it is likely that his
   information was derived from this vicinity,) and is still in
   circulation. That the fish was introduced from some continental
   lake, I have little doubt, but would rather attribute the
   circumstance to some of the religious establishments which at one
   time prevailed in the neighbourhood, and which were well known to
   pay considerable attention both to the table and cellar. The
   introduction must have taken place by means of spawn: the fish
   themselves could not be transported alive even a few miles. They
   are not confined to the castle loch, but are found in several
   others, some of which have no communication with that where they
   are thought peculiar. In general habits, the Vendace nearly
   resemble the Gwyniad, and indeed most of the allied species of
   the genus."</p>

<p>Mr. Yarrell gives representations of two magnified specimens of their
food.</p>

<span>MACARONIC POETRY.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 166.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Perhaps some of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." who take an interest in
this style of composition are not acquainted with the two following
productions, which appeared at Oxford several years ago, the author of
the first being an accomplished first-class man, and, I think, a member
of Worcester College:</p>

<p>1. "Vi√¶ per Angliam ferro strat√¶." (The Railroads);</p>

<p>2. "Poema Canino-Anglico-Latinum, super adventu recenti serenissimarum
Principum." (The Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria.)</p>

<p>The perusal of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNISH'S</span> curious communication (Vol. v., p. 251.)
also reminds me of the subjoined clever and amusing verses which were
written by a talented friend and schoolfellow, whose premature decease
occurred about two years ago, and which appear to be well worthy of
publication. It will be seen that the words, which<a id="Page_303"></a> <span class="pagenum">[303]</span> are all Latin,
are quite unconnected and unmeaning, but when separated or united they
become converted into our own language, or rather into a mixture of
English and Irish. I have thought it absolutely necessary to annex a key.</p>

<span><i>Cooper's Miniatures of Cromwell</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 368.; Vol. v., pp. 17. 92. 189. 234. 255.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Eight years ago I saw, at the house of my friend,
A. Macdonald, Esq., since deceased, but then living in Hyde Park Square,
three miniatures, which were said to be by Cooper, of Cromwell and his
two daughters. The miniatures of the women were, I thought, stiff and
harsh; but that of their father (of which only the head was finished)
appeared to me to be the finest painting of the kind that I ever saw. I
examined it through a strong magnifying glass, when the face exhibited
all the truth and force of a portrait. A high value was set upon it; but
I do not know whether it was sold, or where it is.</p>

<span><i>The Vellum-bound Junius</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iii., p. 262.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> H<span class="smcap lowercase">AGGARD</span> tells us, that from the time he read the private correspondence
between Junius and Woodfall he has examined all book catalogues that
came in his way, in the hope of finding a copy, or the copy, "bound in
vellum"&mdash;so bound by Woodfall, for and at the express desire of Junius.
Of course the edition so bound was "the author's edition," as Junius
calls it, the edition of 1772, printed by H. J. Woodfall. At last, says
MR. HAGGARD, "<i>the long-wished-for object appeared at the Stowe sale</i>;"
but though,<a id="Page_304"></a> <span class="pagenum">[304]</span> he bid eight pounds, he was not so fortunate as to
obtain it. Thus far all is simple and clear enough. But then MR. HAGGARD
subsequently informs us (Vol. iii., p. 307.) that the reason of his
"being so desirous to procure this copy" was, because it was "not only
bound in vellum, but was printed on that article"&mdash;that is, as I
understand it, because it was <i>not</i> the copy bound by Woodfall for
Junius. I am at a loss to reconcile these statements. However, as I
observe by the periodicals that
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">AGGARD'S</span> first statement is getting
into circulation, and that it now assumes this form&mdash;that the
vellum-bound copy of Junius presented by Woodfall to Junius was sold at
the Stowe sale, I think it right to state, that the Stowe copy, printed
on and bound in vellum, was, as I am informed on good authority, not the
edition of 1772&mdash;not a Woodfall edition at all&mdash;but the common
illustrated edition, printed more than thirty years after, by Bensley,
for Vernor and Hood.</p>

<p>&mdash;I am indebted to the Rev. J.
Sanford, orderly preacher at the Rolls chapel, for the subjoined curious
statement, which you may add, if you please, to the instances of female
fecundity already recorded in your pages.</p>

<p>The Marchese Frescobaldi, the representative of one of the most ancient
Florentine families, is still possessed of a portrait of his ancestress,
Dionora Salviati, wife of Bartolomeo Frescobaldi of the same house. She
gave birth to fifty-two children, never less than three at a time; and
there is a tradition in the family that she once had six, and that
twelve were reared. The portrait was painted by the celebrated Bronzino,
who died in 1570, and has recorded the remarkable circumstance in the
following inscription placed under the picture, and in some degree has
thus made himself responsible for the authenticity of the story:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Dionora Salviati moglie di Bartolomeo dei Frascobaldi, fece 52
   figli, e mai meno di tre per parto, come riferesce Gio. Schenzio
   nei libri delle osservazioni amirabili, cioe nel libro quarto de
   Parto a carta 144."</p>

<p>Relative to extraordinary births, I may mention that within half a dozen
miles of this city, and not more than six weeks since, a poor woman gave
birth to four children, two of each sex, and all, with the mother, doing
well. Some millions are born without such, as I may term it, a
phenomenon.</p>

<p>In a very late Brussells paper I find it stated, that in nine years the
wife of a tradesman had twenty-four children, three on each
delivery,&mdash;"chose d√©sesp√©rante (it is added) pour le mari, qui d√©sirait
transmettre son nom, car c'√©taient toutes des filles." Mercier, in his
<i>Tableau de Paris</i> (1786) quotes <i>L'Histoire de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences</i>
of the preceding century for a similar fact, where it is asserted that a
baker's wife had twenty-one children in seven years, three at each
birth, and that he had again three children at a birth by a servant
maid.</p>

found in <i>Domesday Book</i>, Inquisitiones post mortem, &amp;c. It appears that
<i>Norton juxta Twycross</i> was in other days "Nortone, Hoggenortone, Hog's
Norton." There is, then, no doubt as to which of the many Nortons in
England is Hog's Norton: but whether there is now, or ever was, an organ
in the church; or whether a Mr. Pigge, or any number of <i>pigs</i>, played
on one there, I know not.</p>

<p>&mdash;H. M. S. "Wellesley," bearing the
flag of the Earl of Dundonald, on leaving Plymouth for the West Indies,
got under way on <i>Friday</i> the 24th of March, 1848; and, after she had
got outside the breakwater, she was recalled by the Port-admiral, and
did not leave again until the next day: it was to take in the mail-bags,
but the firm belief of the men was, that the gallant admiral purposely
left something behind to avoid going to sea on such an unlucky day as
Friday.</p>

<span><i>Gospel Trees</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. ii., p. 407.; Vol. v., p. 157.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>, in a
recent Number, says that he has somewhere read of a tree called the
"Gospel Elm." May, in his <i>Guide to Stratford-upon-Avon</i>, published
about twenty years since, gives the following description of an elm,
which is probably the one referred to by your correspondent. After
describing the hamlet of Bishopton, he writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In varying our return to Stratford, pursuing thus the path along
   the Henley road, we pass at the town's entrance the now decaying
   'Gospel Tree,' that still indicates the boundary of the borough
   in this direction, towards the 'Dove house close.' In a
   perambulation of the boundaries, made here on the 7th of April,
   1591,<a id="pril3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> this elm&mdash;judging from its now decayed and
   weather-beaten aspect&mdash;is the one there noted as seated on the
   boundary in this direction, whence the line is therein stated as
   continuing, to 'the two elms in Evesham highway.' Such a
   perambulation was anciently made yearly, during Rogation week, by
   the clergy, magistrates, and burgesses; not omitting, for
   evidence' sake, the boys of the grammar school, who then
   doubtless received, as still is customary, some <i>sensitive</i>
   reminiscences of local limitation."&mdash;May's <i>Guide to

in the ensuing remark:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "When the bound mark was a tree, as in the present instance, a
   passage of Scripture was read beneath its branches, a collect was
   recited, and a psalm was sung. Hence its sacred designation, long

<p>&mdash;Near the hamlet of Cressage, co.

missionaries of the Gospel to this land preached. The name of the
hamlet, <i>Cressage</i>, is, I have been told, a contraction of <i>Christ's
Oak</i>.</p>

<p>There is also, near Dudley, a place called <i>Round Oak</i>; and on the road
between Walsall and Lichfield, near the latter, may still be seen the
old <i>Shire Oak</i>.</p>

<p>At <i>Stanford's Bridge</i>, co. Worcester, is a place called the <i>Apostles'
Oak</i>; and in the parish of <i>Hartlebury</i>, in the same county, is a tree
bearing the name of the <i>Mitre Oak</i>. Both these places, and also a
<i>Rock</i>, have contended for the honour of being the scene of the
conference of St. Augustine and the British bishops, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 603. (Nash,

<p>&mdash;As an instance of the "few links" required to connect the present
time with a remote period, I may mention that a grand-aunt of mine who
lived far into the year 1843, remembered perfectly her "uncle
Chamberlaine,"<a id="laine4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who was an officer in King James II.'s army, and who
fought at Aughrim and at Limerick, thus connecting in her own person the
days of the "Monster Meetings" with those of the Revolution of 1688. She
remembered many of the old soldier's anecdotes of the stirring times in
which he lived, and I now regret having been so careless as not to have
taken any Note of them. He was, I believe, the last of his race. I hold
his commission, signed by the celebrated Tyrconnell, and also many old
deeds, some of which are prior to the reign of Richard II., and of which
he was said to be very careful, though on examination they have proved
to be of no value, except as antiques.</p>

<span><i>English Translation of the Canons</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 246.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The Queries of
M. on this subject have arisen out of an error, which I fancy must be
his own. After quoting the clause of the 36th Canon, <i>quodque eodem
taliter uti liceat</i>, he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "The English translation, to which subscription is now made, has
   the following rendering of the second clause: 'And that the same
   may be lawfully used.' The word 'taliter' seems to be not
   rendered at all."</p>

<p>Of course I cannot tell on what authority he says this; but he is
certainly wrong: for in the Oxford edition (1844) of the <i>Homilies and
Canons</i> this clause stands thus: "and that it may lawfully <i>so</i> be
used." And so it is printed in Hodgson's <i>Instructions</i>, p. 8., and in
the Instructions to be observed by Candidates for Holy Orders in the
Diocese of London: and I myself not long ago subscribed to it in this
form. There is then no difference here at all; the Latin being rendered
by the English, not only fully, but literally. I will only add, that the
grammatical meaning of <i>taliter</i>, or <i>so</i>, appears to me in this place
to be plain enough, without requiring a "theological controversy" to
determine it.</p>

<p>&mdash;I am afraid I
did not make myself intelligible in my former communication. Certainly
W. A. C. does not understand me. The question is, are we justified in
translating <i>alibi atque</i> "otherwhere than," in like manner as we
translate <i>aliter atque</i> "otherwise than?" W. A. C. takes for granted
that the line in question refers to only one district. But that is the
very point in doubt. The "head master's" translation makes it refer to
two.</p>

<span><i>Horn-blowing</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 148.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In reference to this practice, I may
state that a similar custom prevails here (Gainsborough, Lincolnshire),
but on the 29th May, or "Royal Oak Day." For some days previously the
boys collect all the birds' eggs they can find or purchase, and early in
the morning of the 29th, they may be seen returning from the woods in
crowds, with an ample supply of oak. They next procure a large quantity
of flowers, with which they construct a garland in the form of a crown,
the apples of the oak being all gilded, surrounded by flowers and
festoons of birds' eggs. The garland is then suspended across the
street, and every little urchin being provided with a horn, some the
natural horn of the cow, others of tin, similar to those formerly used
by the guard of the mail coaches, they keep up throughout the day a most
terrible blowing of horns; the doleful noise being ill in accordance
with the festivity and rejoicing which the garlands are presumed to
indicate. I have been unable to learn the origin or import of this
singular custom.</p>

Proceedings</i>) Mr. S. Tymms says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The small-pox has been a frequent visitor of Bury in its most
   terrible forms. In 1677, says Gillingwater (<i>Hist. Bury</i>, 226.),
   it was so prevalent that the people resorting to the market by
   the Rislygate Road, were accustomed to dip their money in water
   (tradition says vinegar) which had been placed in <i>the cavity of
   the ruined base of the boundary cross</i> situate at the bottom of
   Chalk Lane, with the view of preventing any infection being
   conveyed to the neighbouring towns and villages."</p>

<p>My attention has been frequently called to a stone of similar
description standing in the parish of Stuston in this county, by the
side of the Ipswich and Norwich turnpike; it is called in Kirby's
<i>Suffolk Traveller</i>, 1st ed. pp. 52-3., a "Stuston Stone" and "The White
Stone," and is nearly equidistant from Diss and Eye, between two and
three miles.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cimmerii</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 188.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The belief that the Cymry are descended
from Gomer can prove very little as to the restlessness of those who
hold it; and if it is making progress, the opinion must be supported by
probability: consequently a mere denial will not dispel the illusion.
Authors quite as remarkable for their matter-of-fact opinions as A. N.
may be, have not rejected the connexion of the Cymry with Gomer. For
instance, Volney, in his attacks on Scripture history, when examining
Gen. x. on Gomer, adopts an argument in support of this paternity,
though not in its Biblical sense, viewing Gomer as a chief. As it is not
an unusual circumstance for a nation to adopt the name of its patriarch
or founder (and on this point I would refer to a note to Gibbon's
<i>Decline</i>, chap. lxiv.), I trust I shall be excused for believing myself
descended from Gomer, until decided evidence is adduced that I am not.</p>

<p>Pompeius Festus I am unacquainted with; but on consulting Plutarch, in
Mario, the following contradictory statements may be seen: "The Germans
called banditti <i>Cimbri</i>;" and, "Hence, therefore, these barbarians who
came into Italy first issued; being anciently called <i>Cimmerii</i>, and
afterwards <i>Cimbri</i>, and the appellation was <i>not at all from their
manners</i>."</p>

<p>That the old Germans may have called robbers <i>Cimbri</i>, does not prove
that word implies <i>robbers</i>, or anything of the kind; but it indicates
that the intrusion of the old Germans on the lands of the Cimbri caused
the invaded to make reprisals on the invaders; and then the injured
Germans connected or identified the Cimbrian name with that of enemy or
robber.</p>

<span><i>Stoke</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 106. 161. 213.).</span>

<p>&mdash;I think that the towns and
parishes of <i>Tawstock</i>, <i>Culmstock</i>, <i>Tavistock</i>, <i>Plymstock</i>, <i>Stockton
on Tees</i>, <i>Severn Stoke</i>, <i>Stoke in Teignhead</i>, <i>Stoke on Tern</i>, <i>Stoke
on Trent</i>, must have received their names from a <i>stockade</i> of some kind
<i>in</i> the rivers near which they are situated. There is at a ford across
the river Severn, about half a mile from Welsh Pool, a weir made of
stakes and brushwood erected a few yards above the ford, for the sole
purpose of diminishing the force of the current, and spreading the water
into a stream of an uniform depth. I conjecture that in ancient times
the fords of our larger rivers were kept in a passable state during the
winter season by weirs of this description, and that there were fords in
the rivers at the places above mentioned. There is near Nuneaton the
chapelry of <i>Stock in Ford</i>, but I am not sufficiently acquainted with
that place to be able to conjecture from what circumstance it may have
derived its name. I infer that one meaning of the word <i>stoke</i> is <i>wood</i>
of any kind, from the fact that the opening through which coals are
introduced under the larger boilers in our houses is called a
<i>stoke-hole</i>, from the wood formerly used for fuel.</p>

<p>&mdash;See Blomefield's
<i>History of Norfolk</i>, vol. i. p. 406., and vol. ii. p. 388. At the
latter reference, under the head of Richard Nykke or Nix, Bishop of
Norwich, 1500, occurs this passage: "This bishop incurred a premunire
for extending his jurisdiction over the Mayor of Thetford, and was fined
for it. With part of the fine, it is said, the beautiful windows in
King's College Chapel, Cambridge, were purchased." The statement is
given at greater length at the first of the above-quoted references. I
never heard of the story before I met with it in Blomefield.</p>

    <p class="right"> T. H. L.</p>


<p>Mr. Blomefield, referring to Richard Nykke, Bishop of Norwich
(1500-1535), says he incurred<a id="Page_309"></a> <span class="pagenum">[309]</span> a premunire for extending his
jurisdiction over the Mayor of Thetford, "and was fined for it, with
part of which fine <i>'tis said</i> the beautiful painted glass windows in
King's College Chapel at Cambridge were purchased."&mdash;<i>Hist. of Norfolk</i>,
8vo. edit., ii. 52.; iii. 546.</p>

<p>There is good foundation for the statement that this bishop "was
condemned in the premunire" (Coke's <i>Reports</i>, xii. 40, 41.); but I
question if there be authentic evidence that he "redeemed the punishment
of that offence by the glasing of the King's College Chappell windows in
Cambridge." Bishop Nykke is no doubt the prelate to whom Ferne alludes.</p>

<p> never was Bishop of Ely. John
Lord Berkeley of Stratton, the second son of John Berkeley, was a
British admiral; he died on the 27th of July, 1696-7, not more than
thirty-four years of age, during eight of which he had filled the office
of admiral. See Rose's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;C. I. P. will, I think, find
much of the information required in David Macpherson's <i>Annals of
Commerce</i>, London, 1805, 4 vols. 4to. particularly in vols. iii. and
iv.; also in <i>The History of European Commerce with India</i>, by the same
author, London 1812, 4to. Neither of them is entered in the Bodleian

<h4>
<span><i>Game of Curling</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 13.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The third volume of Tytler's
<i>Lives of Scottish Worthies</i> (No. 37. of the <i>Family Library</i>) contains
a series of antiquarian illustrations, of which the last is devoted to
"Ancient Scottish Games and Amusements." The author refers particularly
to the MS. accounts of the Lord High Treasurer during the reign of King
James IV. (1488-1513), in which, however, there appears to be no notice
of the "roaring game." The origin of this favourite amusement is
certainly involved in mystery, and I have repeatedly failed in my
endeavours to ascertain the meaning of the name by which the game is
known. On consulting the abridgment of Jamieson's <i>Dictionary</i> for the
derivation, I find the following:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Perhaps from Teut. <i>krollen</i>, <i>krull-en</i>, sinuare, flectere,
   whence E. <i>curl</i>; as the great art of the game is to make the
   stones bend or curve in towards the mark, when it is so blocked
   up that they cannot be directed in a straight line."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ancient Trees</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 401. &amp;c.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Notwithstanding the assertion
of Dr. Johnson, many fine specimens of timber have long existed to the
north of the Tweed. At p. 20. of the <i>Edinburgh Antiquarian Magazine</i>
(Edin. 1848) will be found a "List of Scottish Trees, of remarkable
magnitude, as they existed in 1812," including numerous examples of the
oak, larch, ash, elm, beech, silver fir, Scots fir, sycamore, chesnut,
black poplar, and yew. One of the largest in the catalogue is the great
yew at Fortingal, in Perthshire, measured by the Hon. Judge Barrington
in 1768, when its circumference was no less than fifty-two feet.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Paring the Nails, &amp;c.</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 142. &amp;c.).&mdash;</span>
</h4>

<p class="blockquot"> "Now no superfluity of our food, or in general no excrementitious
   substance, is looked upon by them (the Egyptian priests) as pure
   and clean; such, however, are all kinds of wool and down, our
   hair and our nails. It would be the highest absurdity therefore
   for those who, whilst they are in a course of purification, are
   at so much pains to take off the hair from every part of their
   own bodies, at the same time to cloath themselves with that of
   other animals. So when we are told by Hesiod 'not to pare our
   nails, whilst we are present at the festivals of the Gods,' we
   ought so to understand him as if he designed hereby to inculcate
   that purity with which we ought to come prepared, before we enter
   upon any religious duty, that we have not to make ourselves
   clean, whilst we ought to be occupied in attending to the
   solemnity itself."&mdash;Plutarch's Treatise of <i>Isis and Osiris</i>,
   translated by Squire, p. 5. 1744.</p>


<p>This note will show the great antiquity of these nail-paring and
hair-cutting superstitions. What is there does not come from Egypt?</p>

<p class="center2">TOMB OF THE TRADESCANTS.</p>

<p>In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of JOHN TRADESCANT the
younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and her son,
who were inhabitants of that parish.</p>

<p>The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The inscription
also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE'S grave, who was himself buried in
Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The restoration of that
Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit occasion for repairing both
these Monuments. It is therefore proposed to raise a fund for the
perfect restoration of the Tomb of the TRADESCANTS, according to its
original form, as represented in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian
Library at Cambridge, and also for renewing ASHMOLE'S epitaph. The cost
will not be less than 100<i>l.</i>, and assistance is earnestly requested
from all who are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those
who are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS, and who are
daily deriving benefit and delight from the labours and discoveries of
these first of English gardeners and naturalists.</p>
